# BG3-Invoke-Duplicity-dupe
Script to make getting the items from the illusion easier

Once again coordinates used are for a (2560x1440) screen, so adjust these at will.

Just cast invoke duplicity on a level 2 trickery domain cleric and open the illusions inventory with I.
Then in the script enter the code for the item you wish to pick and it will get it for you.

Then press tab and drag the item over to your other characters :)
